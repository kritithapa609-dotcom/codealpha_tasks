# codealpha_tasks

This repository contains three machine learning projects developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 
These projects are created for learning purposes and academic submission.

# 1. Car Sales Prediction
In this project, past car sales data is used to predict future car sales.
The model studies previous sales patterns and helps in understanding demand for cars.
This project shows how machine learning can be used in the automobile industry.

# 2. Sales Prediction
This project focuses on predicting future sales based on historical sales data.
It helps businesses plan inventory, marketing strategies, and expected profit.
Machine learning techniques are used to analyze sales trends and make predictions.

# 3. Iris Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The classification is done using flower measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
This project demonstrates the working of supervised machine learning algorithms.

# Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn


These projects helped me understand the basic concepts of machine learning such as data preprocessing, training models, and making predictions.
